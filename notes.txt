function declaration vs function expression:
- function declaration: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function
- function expression: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function
- arrow function: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions

The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.
A function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which runs as soon as it is defined.
